</code></pre></div><p>If you've got similar output, this means that your Docker installation is successful and your Docker Cli can communicate with Docker Daemon without any problem. This output also shows us Docker Cli - Docker Daemon versions and their details. In case of you get <code>Error response from daemon: open \\.\pipe\docker_engine_linux: The system cannot find the file specified.</code> This means that Docker Cli could not connect to the Docker Daemon and probably the reason is that Docker Daemon didn't start properly. Just try to start the daemon process and retry again.

  <span class="token punctuation">[</span>…<span class="token punctuation">]</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Docker Cli is fairly simple to figure out how to use it. Just type <code>docker</code> and after that type the command that you want to execute + options that you want to use. That simple. For example, simple Docker command to run a container is <code>docker run hello-world</code>. This will create a container by hello-world Docker image. <code>docker run --name azuredevcol hello-world</code> this will create another container using the same image but this time container will have a name &quot;azuredevcol&quot;. You see, it's quite simple. But it got complicated day after day. Docker had roughly 40 top-level solo commands like run, inspect, build, attach etc. While these commands worked very well for a while, they had a few issues and Docker decided to solve these issues by introducing the management commands. Docker started to group these commands logically with Docker Cli version 1.13 and called these new groups as management commands. Each group represents a single Docker object or ability. For example, all the commands related to container objects are grouped together under the &quot;container&quot; management command. Going back to the previous example, simple Docker command to run a container was <code>docker run hello-world</code>. Now it's <code>docker container run hello-world</code>. Docker Cli is backward-compatible so it still supports old way of cli but management command approach is the future.</p> <p>Long story short, Docker Cli syntax is fairly simple. Just type <code>docker</code> and after that type the management command of the object that you want to play, like <code>image</code>, <code>container</code>, <code>volume</code> and after that type the command that you want to execute, like <code>run</code>, <code>stop</code>, <code>pull</code>, <code>inspect</code> + options that you want to use. Couple of examples:</p> <div class="language-shell extra-class"><pre class="language-shell"><code>$ docker container run --name container1 ubuntu <span class="token function">ping</span> <span class="token number">10.0</span>.0.1

$ docker image pull mysql:5.7

$ docker volume create my_first_volume

$ docker network inspect bridge
</code></pre></div><p>But how do we know which commands we can use and which options do we have? Simple. Just by asking for help to Docker Cli. Let's say that we want to create our first Docker container but we don't know which command and options that we can use. We can ask this to Docker Cli simply using <code>--help</code> option.</p> <p>Type:</p> <div class="language-shell extra-class"><pre class="language-shell"><code>$ docker container --help
</code></pre></div><p>Output will be something like:</p> <div class="language-shell extra-class"><pre class="language-shell"><code>Usage:  docker container COMMAND

If you don't specify in which image registry is your image stored, Docker assumes that it's stored at Docker Hub &quot;docker.io/library/hello-world&quot;. We also wanted to pull image called &quot;hello-world&quot; but as can be seen from the output, Docker pulled the image called  <strong>hello-world:latest</strong>&quot;. What's that <strong>:latest</strong>?</p> <p>An image name is made up of slash-separated name components and tags, optionally prefixed by a registry hostname. Registry hostname represents that in which registry that image is stored. Slash-separated name components represent the repository of the image in that image registry. Last part, which is called tag, represents the version of the image. It's meta-data you can use to distinguish versions of your Docker images. <strong>:latest</strong> is the default tag used by Docker. If it's not tagged otherwise, images are tagged as <strong>:latest</strong> by default. And if you don't specify the tag while working with Docker images, Docker always assumes that you're pointing the image tagged as <strong>:latest</strong>.</p> <p>Let's type <code>docker image ls</code> one more time.</p> <div class="language-shell extra-class"><pre class="language-shell"><code>REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE

</code></pre></div><p>Congratulations! You have created your first Docker container. But what has actually happened behind the scene?</p> <p>You typed the command <code>docker container run hello-world</code> and instructed to Docker Daemon that you wanted to create a new container by the image called hello-world and run a command inside that container.</p> <ul><li>Docker Cli took your command and connected to Docker Daemon over its rest api and passed that command.</li> <li>Docker Daemon checked if the image called <code>hello-world:latest</code> is stored locally or not. If it couldn't find the image, it would start to pull that from its registry. But we already pulled that image a few minutes ago, so it didn't pull that again.</li> <li>Docker created a new container from that image and assigned a random id to that container. It also assigned a random name too, because we didn't specify any name using --name option on our command. After that, the container has been created. But it's only created, it has not been started yet. &quot;btw couple of other things also have happened like r/w layer, networks etc. but we'll come to these details later&quot;</li> <li>Actually <code>docker container run</code> command means that we want to run a command inside a new container. If it isn't specified which command to run, Docker runs the default command instructed on the image. In our case, we didn't specify any command to run inside the container. Therefore Docker started the container that it created and ran the default command instructed on the image. In our case this command is <code>/hello</code>. &quot;hello&quot; is a very simple console application. When you run that, it echos &quot;Hello from Docker! This message shows ...&quot; message on the console and exits.</li> <li>Unless otherwise stated, Docker attaches to the container's shell and shows the output of that shell &quot;stdout, stderr&quot; on your console. That is the reason why we could see the output generated by the &quot;/hello&quot; application on our terminal.</li> <li><strong>Golden Rule:</strong> Each Docker image has a default application-command to run, when a container is created from that image. This is instructed in the Docker image. But you can overwrite this instruction and point another application-command to run when container is created. When Docker starts a container, it starts this command-application and also monitors the process which has triggered by this command-application. This application is always the PID1. Docker monitors the PID1. If PID1 continues to run, container continues to run. If PID1 is killed or stopped, container exits.</li> <li>In our case, it was the application called '/hello'. When we typed <code>docker container run hello-world</code>, Docker created a new container from &quot;hello-world&quot; image and started it. The default application which has been instructed to run when a container has been created from hello-world image is &quot;/hello&quot;. Therefore, &quot;/hello&quot; application has started. It has done what it is programmed for and when finished, it is closed. &quot;/hello&quot; isn't a daemon or long running service etc, so when it has done its job, it is closed. When Docker detected that the PID1 is not running any more, Docker closed the container too.</li></ul> <p>Let's turn back to terminal and type:</p> <div class="language-shell extra-class"><pre class="language-shell"><code>$ docker container <span class="token function">ls</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Finally we could see the container that we created a few seconds ago on the list. ID and Name sections are different on your system than this output. When Docker containers are created, the system automatically assigns a universally unique identifier (UUID) number to each container. That is the case for other Docker objects too &quot;image, container, volume etc.&quot;. Each Docker object has a universally unique identifier. These are 64 character SHA-256 IDs. Docker commands truncate them to 12 characters and that's the reason why we saw just first 12 characters of the ID. In addition to that, Docker assigns names to the containers. If we don't specify the name with <code>--name</code> option, Docker generates a random name using an open source list of adjectives and known figures in science and IT world. We can use those IDs and names interchangeable when we call the container and we'll see couple of examples in a few minutes. Other sections on that list are Image, Command, Created, Status and Ports. &quot;Image&quot; is the image that was used to create this container. &quot;Command&quot; is the command that was executed inside the container when we started it. &quot;Created&quot; is the timestamp of the creation time. &quot;Status&quot; is the current status of the container and in our case it is &quot;Exited&quot; which means that, container is stopped. &quot;Ports&quot; section shows us the exposed ports from that container but it's empty at the moment because we didn't expose any port.</p> <p>Container has been created and &quot;hello&quot; application has started in the container. It has completed its duties and closed, therefore container is closed too. Let's continue to play with this container and start that container again. We will use container id as a reference in this.</p> <div class="language-shell extra-class"><pre class="language-shell"><code>$ docker container start 93a <span class="token comment"># just first a few characters of the container id would be enough</span>

</code></pre></div><p>We didn't get any output this time. Instead of that, Docker returned the container id that we typed. That is normal. When we typed the <code>docker container run</code> command and created this container a few minutes ago, our console has been attached to the container's shell and we saw the output. But with <code>docker container start</code> this doesn't happen. <code>docker container start</code> starts the stopped container and reruns the default command. In our case, it started the &quot;hello&quot; console application again. &quot;hello&quot; console application recreated the message and send it to the &quot;stdout&quot; stream of the console's shell. We didn't attach to that shell so we didn't see the output. But output is there. We can see any output that has been generated by the container with <code>docker logs</code> command. Let's do that but this time let's use the container's name instead of the id.</p> <div class="language-shell extra-class"><pre class="language-shell"><code>$ docker logs amazing_wu <span class="token comment">#name of the container</span>

UNIX and Linux commands typically open three I/O streams when they run, called STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR. STDIN is the command’s input stream, which may include input from the keyboard or input from another command. STDOUT is usually a command’s normal output, and STDERR is typically used to output error messages. By default, <code>docker logs</code> shows the STDOUT and STDERR streams of the container since it was created. Our container wasn't killed. When we first ran the container, it was stopped automatically after its PID1 was stopped. We started the container one more time with <code>docker container start</code> command again. Process was restarted, generated the same message and stopped again. Container was stopped too. But it wasn't killed. So we can still see all the STDOUT and STDERR messages since the creation of the container.

But this time we'll create it detached. Docker containers start in the foreground mode by default. Like the one that we created a few minutes ago. In the foreground mode, Docker starts the default process in the container and attaches your console to the process’s STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR streams. But when this happens, you can not access your own console anymore. You just see the output generated by the container on your screen. To avoid this, we can start a container in the background mode which is also called detached and the option that gives you this ability is <code>-d</code>. Running a container in the foreground or background modes don't change its behavior. This is just about if we want to attach to the container's streams or not. Let's create a new container in the background &quot;detached&quot; and also this time let's define a name too.</p> <p>Type:</p> <div class="language-shell extra-class"><pre class="language-shell"><code>$ docker container run -d --name azuredevcol hello-world

A new container has been created using hello-world:latest image, container has been started, default application inside the container started, it did its thing, app stopped so container stopped too. If you type <code>docker logs azuredevcol</code> , you can see the logs generated by the application running inside the container. Now let's create another container but we'll use another image <code>httpd</code> this time which is the official Apache HTTP Server Docker image.</p> <p>Type:</p> <div class="language-shell extra-class"><pre class="language-shell"><code>$ docker container run -d --name webserver httpd

Docker took our command, checked the local image store and couldn't find the image called httpd. It started to pull the image from Docker Hub. As you can see from the output, it completed this pulling process in 5 steps. Docker pulled 5 different layers. We'll come to this layer thing later but for now just notice that, this operation was handled as multiple steps. At the end, Docker combined these layers and save them to the local store and returned us back the id of the image. After that Docker created the container, started it and returned us back the container id.

</code></pre></div><p>Output will be something like:</p> <div class="language-shell extra-class"><pre class="language-shell"><code>d4463417f9946f9d2cabfdca5ac81f45b7d2a2f4dc8299b9d36922b8d4b23111
</code></pre></div><p>with &quot;inspect&quot; command we can see all the details of this or any container.</p> <p>Type:</p> <div class="language-shell extra-class"><pre class="language-shell"><code>$ docker container inspect inspect_test
</code></pre></div><p>Output will be something like:</p> <div class="language-shell extra-class"><pre class="language-shell"><code><span class="token punctuation">[</span>
